Hello everyone,

Welcome to my mini project Aim trainer using python.
It's one of my initial projects.

Basically it is a tool to master your aim, making it fast & accurate.
the main.py file contains the aim trainer source code.

Make sure that you've the pygame library installed on your system 

If not then open your terminal & type the command: pip3 install pygame
to install pygame on your system
